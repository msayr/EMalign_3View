    Given a list of overlaping image stacks, tries to calculate a transformation between each pair of tiles and check the overlap using a laplacian filter.
    Based on transformation, tiles are placed on a grid for further processing. Tiles that are found not to overlap well enough are split into multiple stacks.

    
    Args:

        combined_stacks (`list[Stack]`):

            List of overlapping image stacks.

            Whether or not to apply gaussian filter with default parameters.

        apply_clahe (``bool``):

            Whether or not to apply CLAHE with default parameters.

        scale (`list[float]`):

            Scales to downsample images to for finding transformation with sift (1 = downsampling). 
            If offset computations fail at scale[0], will try scale[1].

        overlap_score_threshold (``float``):
         
            Determines the cutoff for how good overlap needs to be. Based on an index of overlap between 0 (bad) and 1 (perfect).

            Determines the maximum allowed rotation in degrees for a tile to be considered overlapping. 
            Too much rotation will mess with downstream computations for stitching. Will be implemented in the future.
