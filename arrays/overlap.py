    Extract overlapping parts of two images based on an offset and rotation from img2 to img1.

    Parameters:

        Reference image
    img2 : np.ndarray
        Moving image to align with img1
    offset : tuple or array-like

    rotation : float, optional
        Rotation angle in degrees to apply to img2 before computing overlap. Default: 0

        Additional padding to extend the overlap region. Default: 0
    homogenize_shapes : bool, optional
        If True, ensures both cropped regions have identical shapes by trimming to minimum.

    Notes:

    - Negative x offset: img2 is to the left of img1

def get_overlap_warp(ref_img, mov_img, ref_mask, mov_mask, M, mov_img_shape, ref_img_offset):
    '''
    Extract overlapping regions after applying affine transformation and alignment.

    This function warps images and masks using an affine transformation matrix,
    pads them to match alignment offsets, homogenizes shapes, and extracts the
    overlapping region based on the intersection of masks.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    ref_img : np.ndarray
        Reference image
    mov_img : np.ndarray
        Moving image to be warped and aligned
    ref_mask : np.ndarray (bool)
        Boolean mask indicating valid regions in reference image
    mov_mask : np.ndarray (bool)
        Boolean mask indicating valid regions in moving image
    M : np.ndarray
        2x3 affine transformation matrix for warping
    mov_img_shape : tuple
        Target shape (height, width) for the warped moving image
    ref_img_offset : tuple or array-like
        (x, y) offset to pad the reference image for alignment

    Returns:
    --------
    tuple of np.ndarray
        (ref_crop, mov_crop) - Cropped overlapping regions from reference and moving images,
        bounded by the intersection of both masks.

    Notes:
    ------
    - The moving image is warped using the affine transformation M
    - The reference mask is also warped to match the moving image coordinate system
    - Both images are padded and resized to have identical shapes
    - The final overlap is determined by the bounding box of (ref_mask & mov_mask)

    '''
    Compute a quality metric describing how well two images overlap based on edge content similarity.

    This function uses Laplacian variance to assess the similarity of edge content in the
    overlapping regions of two images. Optionally, it can refine the alignment using SIFT
    feature matching if the initial overlap quality is below a threshold.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    img1 : np.ndarray
        Reference image
    img2 : np.ndarray
        Moving image to compare with img1
    xy_offset : tuple or array-like
        (x, y) offset describing the displacement of img2 relative to img1
    theta : float
        Rotation angle in degrees to apply to img2
    threshold : float, optional
        Quality threshold below which refinement is triggered if refine is True. Range [0,1].
        Default: 0.5
    scale : tuple of float, optional
        Two scale factors to try for SIFT-based refinement. Default: (0.3, 0.5)
    refine : bool, optional
        If True, attempts to refine the overlap using SIFT when quality is below threshold.
        Default: True

    Returns:
    --------
    float
        Overlap quality metric in range [0,1]:
        - 1.0: Perfect overlap, identical edge content
        - 0.0: No overlap or completely different edge content
        - Values closer to 1 indicate better alignment

    Notes:
    ------
    - Uses Laplacian variance to measure edge content similarity
    - If refinement is enabled and quality < threshold, attempts SIFT-based realignment
    - Tries two different scale factors for SIFT refinement
    - Returns 0 if images don't overlap geometrically
